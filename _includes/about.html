    <p>During my PhD I developed methods to connect a particular early-universe signature to today's sky,
    making its precise calculation feasible for the first time.
    These methods are described in my paper
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08546">Probing Inflation with Precision Bispectra</a>
    (published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics)
    and have been implemented in the Primodal code,
    soon to be released.</p>
