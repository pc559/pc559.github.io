    <p>During my PhD I developed methods to connect a particular early-universe signature to today's sky,
    making its precise calculation feasible for the first time.
    These methods are described in my paper
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08546">Probing Inflation with Precision Bispectra</a>
    (published in the Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics)
    and have been implemented in the Primodal code,
    soon to be released.</p>

    <h2>Code</h2>
    <p>
    I've been working on some small projects recently to sharpen my knowledge of common data science tools.
    First I asked the question,
    <a href="https://github.com/pc559/weekend_births_analysis/blob/main/ons_births_model.ipynb">which days have fewer births?</a>
    Pandas helped a lot with making the many plots that helped find the answers. It was pretty interesting!
    Another write-up is a little exploration of
    <a href="https://github.com/pc559/pca_losing_cluster/blob/main/pca_losing_cluster.ipynb">PCA and clustering</a>.
    I wanted to practise using Sklearn, especially writing things in terms of pipelines,
    and gain some intuition for how clustering and PCA interact.
    There's more to come - I'm currently writing up a comparison of different models and preprocessing choices
    applied to MNIST, looking forward to posting that here soon.

    Here's some fun code for demonstrating
    <a href="https://github.com/pc559/thin-lens">gravitational lensing</a>.
    It warps your webcam feed in the same way gravity warps passing light.
    If you'd like to use this code for a physics demo, let me know if you have any trouble
    getting it working!
    A bit more technical; here is some code for generating
    <a href="https://github.com/pc559/arbitrary_points_integrator">weights for numerical integration</a>.
    In my PhD I needed to integrate a lot of functions over the same sample points extremely
    efficiently - this is the code that let me do that.
